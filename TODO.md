- make BitString support non-byte multiples
- @runtimeMetadata instead of property wrappers?
- support for REAL in ASN1Kit for Decimal, Float and Double
- make ASN1Kit OID representation [UInt]
- support for nested SEQUENCE (structs)
- super decoders
- propagate originalEncoding (\_save) in all cases
- ASN1RawRepresentableBitString<BInt>
- AnyCodable, make it ASN.1 compile to eliminate special cases
- compiler needs to support nested wrapped initializers
