- @runtimeMetadata instead of property wrappers?
- support for REAL in ASN1Kit for Decimal, Float and Double
- make ASN1Kit OID representation [UInt] or Data
- support for nested SEQUENCE (structs)
- compiler needs to support nested wrapped initializers
- super decoders
- propagate originalEncoding (\_save) in all cases
- ASN1RawRepresentableBitString<BInt>
- AnyCodable does not round trip Data
